# Nodejs_practice
This repository is based off of academind's Node.js youtube series. Any base is taken from their videos and developed as I learn. The goal is to learn about node.js 
and contribute my own designs to the base they have covered. 

Some folders require dependencies to be installed such as npm, express etc.
